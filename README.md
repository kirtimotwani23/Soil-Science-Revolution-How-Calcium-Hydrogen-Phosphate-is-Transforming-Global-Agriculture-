Market Size

The global Calcium Hydrogen Phosphate for Agriculture market was valued at USD 623 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 849.09 million by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 3.50% during the forecast period. The market has witnessed consistent growth due to the rising demand for phosphate-based fertilizers, driven by increasing agricultural activities worldwide. Historical trends indicate a steady rise in market valuation due to technological advancements in fertilizer production and the expanding agricultural sector in emerging economies.

Calcium Hydrogen Phosphate, commonly referred to as Dicalcium Phosphate (DCP), is an essential phosphate compound used in agriculture, particularly in fertilizers. It serves as a primary source of phosphorus, a crucial nutrient for plant growth. The agricultural-grade DCP is widely utilized as a raw material in phosphate and compound fertilizers due to its water-soluble phosphorus content. This characteristic makes it an effective and cost-efficient ingredient for improving soil fertility and enhancing crop yields.
